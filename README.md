# Cats-vs-dogs-
This cats vs dogs model is built using the PyTorch deep learning framework, which is known for its ease of use and flexibility. The model utilizes a convolutional neural network architecture, which has been shown to be highly effective for image classification tasks.

To train the model, i utilized a dataset of images of cats and dogs, which i preprocessed to ensure that all images were of the same size and in the same format. I then split the dataset into training and validation sets, with the former used to train the model and the latter used to evaluate its performance.

Overall, this cats vs dogs model is an excellent example of the power of PyTorch for deep learning tasks, and it has the potential to be applied in a wide range of applications.
